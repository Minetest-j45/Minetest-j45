### Hi there 👋
Im a 15 year old coder from England<br/>
I first got into programming when i was playing Minetest(https://github.com/minetest/minetest), which is an open source sandbox game and i wanted to mod it, which is done in Lua<br/>
Im currently learning Golang i hope to have alot of fun with it but also to make useful programs<br/>
